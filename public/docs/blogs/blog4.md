Opinion in and outside of Tanzania will remain divided on the legacy of the late President John Magufuli. Whatever the case, there is one thing you can’t take away from him: he was a fiscal disciplinarian and restored order in Tanzania’s public finances. From the moment he was sworn in as the country’s fifth President, he set about building a robust ringfence around Tanzania’s fiscus. First in his list was enhancing revenues collection. And to improve domestic revenue mobilization, he instituted revenue administration reforms. A key highlight of the reforms was the reduction in the generous tax exemptions and rebates granted in the past, and a hidden cost in public finances. The result was impressive. Tax exemptions and rebates declined from a whopping 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012 to under one percent in 2019. He also enforced the use of Electronic fiscal devices (EFDs) as well as introduction of value-added tax (VAT) and customs reforms. Another highlight was his face-off with the multinationals and other entities operating in the country’s lucrative extractive sector, which comprises minerals and oil and gas, over revenue understatements. His face-off worked and the multinationals budged. Data from Extractive Industries’ Transparency Initiative (EITI) shows that between fiscal years 2014/15 and 2017/18, a period of just three years, extractive royalties paid to the State surged by 75 percent while extractive taxes paid to Tanzania Revenue Authority more than tripled.

The broad result was (i) aggregate revenue outturn, which measures the extent to which aggregate revenue receipts reflect the amount originally approved in the budget, greatly improved with collections rising from 85 percent of total revenues budgeted in 2014 to 95 percent in 2016; and (ii) as a percentage of GDP, tax collections improved from 12.8 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2014/15 to 15 percent in 2019/20. At a time when her next-door neighbour Kenya, the largest economy in the East African Community (EAC), has been struggling with declining tax revenue relative to economic output (Kenya’s tax revenue as a share of GDP has been declining from 17 % in 2013/14 to 14 % in 2019/20), this was quite commendable.

Next up was public expenditures, where he took a two-pronged approach. First, he instituted a public service purge, reduced the number of ministries and clamped on foreign travel by public service officials (including himself making very limited foreign travels). The result was staggering. Recurrent expenditures as a share of government revenues plunged from over 100 percent in 2012/13 to 68 percent by the close of fiscal year 2019/20. Even more interesting, Tanzania’s public sector wage bill declined from 48.9 percent of revenues in 2011 to 33 percent of revenues at the close of fiscal year 2019/20. Kenya, on the other hand, continues to struggle with expenditure overruns, debt binge and just plain plunder of the fiscus. Secondly, he streamlined expenditure management in favour of development projects and gave it enhanced attention and financing. Indeed, Magufuli raised development expenditure from 25 percent of total expenditure and net lending in 2014/15 to 39 percent in 2019/20. Kenya, in the same period, directed only 16 percent of its budget towards development, on average terms.

At the same time, he also remained hawk-eyed on development corruption (in fact, he’s best known for declining Chinese financing of Tanzania’s standard gauge railway project citing lack of value for tax-payer money-adding that only a mad man would sign off on such agreements). In April 2016, a few months into his first term, the Public Investment Management – Operational Manual (PIM-OM) was launched. It laid down the procedures for selecting, financing, implementing and evaluating Government projects. A key change introduced by the PIM-OM was the introduction of three defined project ‘types’: Type I  projects with total estimated costs greater than Tsh 50 billion; Type II – Tsh. 5-50 billion; and Type III -Less than Tsh. 5 billion. The Planning Commission, a unit within the Ministry of Finance and holds responsibility for the overall management of Public Investment,  appraises and prioritizes all projects of Type I and II, submitting them for approval by the Joint Public Investment Management Committee (JPIMC), coordinating their financing and implementation and undertaking monitoring and evaluation. In Kenya, it was not until January 2020 that the National Treasury issued Public Investment Management (PIM) Guidelines to guide planning, appraisal, approval and budgeting for all new projects. And even then, and more than a year later, the PIM Unit is yet to develop a manual for economic project appraisal and also a manual for monitoring and evaluation of projects.

With Magufuli seeking to balance budgets, Tanzania’s fiscal deficit, as a share of GDP, narrowed to just two percent in fiscal year 2019/20 compared to 6.5 percent in 2012/13. The narrowing of fiscal deficit also meant his appetite for borrowing waned. When he took over in 2015, public debt stood at 38.8 percent of GDP. By the close of fiscal year 2019/20, that figure had only moved to 47.4 percent of GDP. He also slowed down on external budgetary financing and kept external debt under 40 percent of GDP throughout his first term. The result was that total debt service averaged at 11 percent of revenues in his first term in office. This is in stark contrast to Kenya, where, driven by a debt binge, public debt has risen from 40 percent of GDP in 2012 to 60 percent of GDP in 2020. On average terms, between 2014 and 2020, Kenya spent 37 percent of its revenues on debt service, which is quite elevated. Tanzanians can only hope that its future leaders, including immediate successor Samia Suluhu Hassan, will jealously guard the fiscus as John Magufulu did.
