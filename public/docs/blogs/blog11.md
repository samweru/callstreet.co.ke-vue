Insurance companies are lazy!

Insurance companies in East Africa are served business on a silver platter, literally!
Insurance is an interesting business in East Africa, for two reasons. First, insurance in the region is driven by non-life (or general) business. Out of the USD2.4 billion worth of total gross premiums earned by insurers in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in 2016, non-life premiums accounted for 67 percent (or USD1.6 billion) while life premiums accounted for the balance.

This was at odds with global trends where life premiums accounted for 55 percent of total global premiums in 2016. That oddity notwithstanding, you could safely conclude that non-life business is very representative of the sector. Secondly, classwise, the general insurance business is dominated by motor vehicle insurance. At the close of 2016, motor vehicle business class accounted for 35 percent of total gross premiums-and 51 percent of net earned premiums under the non-life insurance business.

Essentially, there is motor vehicle class is the main driver of the non-life business. And this is for the simple reason that motor vehicle third party liability insurance, which requires motorists to have insurance coverage against risks of bodily injuries and deaths on the part of the pedestrians on the public roads or passengers in public vehicles, is mandatory by law in East Africa. What if the third party liability insurance was not legally mandatory in these countries? Would general insurers still be turning over such large volumes? I doubt. Here’s a flipside: gross premiums attributable to marine insurance only accounted for three percent of total gross premiums earned in 2016. Clearly marine penetration insurance remains very low in East Africa. And the reason is very simple: marine insurance is still not mandatory.

Given that East Africa as a region remains a net importer- you would expect demand for marine insurance to be elevated at all times. In fact, for Kenya, the region’ largest economy, marine penetration figures have been startling. Between 2003 and 2014, the ratio averaged at just zero decimal two; with the highest level being zero decimal four back in 2003. That’s extremely low, especially compared to motor vehicle insurance. So we have a situation where insurance business growth in the region is being tied to statutization. If an insurance policy is not statutory, then it doesn’t have a place in the market. Isn’t this a lazy approach to insurance? Yes it is. In Kenya, importers must now purchase marine insurance onshore-another implementation of the law.

The Permanent Secretary for Maritime Affairs issued this directive sometime in late third quarter 2016 that all importers should insure their cargo with local underwriters effective January 1, 2017. This directive is now in force and let’s marine insurance premiums will post annual double digit growth rates going forward. This is literally handing insurers business on a silver platter. Sometime in 2016 I attended an annual retreat of the Uganda Insurers Association and I was surprised that they were talking of active lobbying to have the Government declare domestic fire insurance mandatory. What calibre of corporate laziness is that? Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance, in a 2014 draft national insurance policy document, cited limited requirement for compulsory insurance as a challenge and constraint facing the country’s insurance sector. Please. Underwriters should stop creeping under the cover of policy interventions in order to domicile new businesses. Are we saying that next up is a directive for domestic fire insurance to be made mandatory for all households in Kenya? This then brings me to my point: aren’t general insurers in East Africa are having it too easy? Yes they are, in my view.

The insurance in the region is now ripe for a disruption. Indeed, I should not be forced by the law to buy a motor third party liability cover. Instead, someone (an insurance company) should sell me the value of a motor third party liability cover, then I make an informed buy decision as a consumer. In the same vein, why should Kenya force importers, through a statute, to buy onshore marine covers when the service providers themselves have failed to build a strong value proposition around the same? In my assessments, in order for insurers to build strong value propositions around their products, they need to first address some of the structural imbalances bedeviling their businesses. And I have identified three of them-which I think are core. First is distribution; and nothing undoubtedly magnifies the tigritude of distribution to the insurance sector more than low uptake of microinsurance products. The current distribution infrastructure doesn’t appear cost-suited to drive products such as microinsurance-partly because underwriters still treat microinsurance products like the conventional insurance products. They will have to re-invent the wheel here. To help decimate distribution constraints, collaboration between mobile network operators (MNOs) and underwriters is inevitable, in the long term. However, managing these relationships will be also be crucial especially in striking a consensus on who really owns the customer (ostensibly to reduce risks of cannibalism).

Some high profile relationships in this space have collapsed before- most notably Kenya’s Linda Jamii, a collaboration between Safaricom, Britam and Changamka Microhealth. Second, there are glaring gaps on the product side. Research is core to product development and underwriters have been encouraged to perfom thorough product research before launching in order to understand client needs (which some rightly do). However, underwriters still lack flexibility and most of the insurance products in the market today have been developed in the boardroom; in fact, today, when you buy an insurance product, you are the one to adapt to the lifestyle of the insurer, while it should be reverse. There is an evident gap between what you, as the customer, want from an insurer and what solutions the underwriter is offering you-and the worry is that the gap isn’t narrowing. Finally, there are elevated levels of lack of awareness today and this is a process that ought to be driven by industry lobbies.

Anecdotal evidences from the more developed insurance markets show that sensitization incubates high retention rates and also creates easy buy-ins. In other words, it is a bit more easy dealing with a fully sensitized customer, especially when it comes to insurance. Let me sign off by saying that, today in East Africa, it’s a fact that underwriters are competing for a very small pie-and price undercutting is the name of the game (and many other shenanigans). Insurance underwriters must wake up from their deep slumber lands; or otherwise wait for some disruptive force-still brewing somewhere in the clouds but is surely circling closer to the earth.
