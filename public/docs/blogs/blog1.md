The NSE returned a -10.37% perfomance of the first 4 months upto April 2011 and this further underpins the volatility that has engulfed the market since the year began. There is certainly a lot of ‘noise’ surrounding Kenya’s 2011 economic prospects with the Planning Ministry, in its 2011 Economic Survey, giving a conservative 3.5-4.5% growth estimate.

Finance Minister Uhuru Kenyatta has, on the contrary, expressed bullish sentiments on 2011 prospects giving a 6.1% forecast. However, knocking off the noise, it is a fact that we are in a nasty inflationary economic environment with April inflation peaking at 12% and in effect investors continue to comb the market for inflation-adjusted returns. Over the last 2 months, local investors have continued to deploy ‘defensive’ strategies accompanied by ‘shallow’ gain taking while their foreign counterparts have largely been ‘risk-on’.

The market has continued to 'tank' and its slowly turning into a 'jig-saw' and it all doesn't make sense at all. Ex-divs and ex-bonus behaviors are even worrying with stocks taking as much as 15-18% dips sending investors into a frenzy. The question is what could be driving all these sentiment erosion. Not even defensive plays seem to arrest the current scenarios and you get wondering just how low it can go. The best-selling strategy so far in 2011 has been 'buying the dips'! In a 'jig-saw scenario', you trough in and short your long positions at the at the tip of the 'blade'; the key is not to be too greedy and cap your gains at 5% threshold. Above threshold will be a bonus but you know you are about to trough in....
