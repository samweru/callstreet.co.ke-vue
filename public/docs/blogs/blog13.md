EABL: Four items from the 2021 financial report worth your attention

As the famous American adage goes, sometimes kicking the tyre can tell you a lot about a car. I have just finished going through East African Breweries Limited 2019 annual financial report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and picked up a few things of interest regarding its operations during the year (and I also provided some historical contexts). First of all, during the year, East African Breweries Limited (EABL) recorded a 15 percent year-on-year growth in net sales to Kshs.86 billion (c.USD796.3 million). Uganda printed the strongest growth, with its revenues growing by 33 percent year-on-year while Tanzania grew by 15 percent year-on-year. Kenya trailed after printing a 10 percent year-on-year growth. For Kenya, the second half of the year printed the strongest growth at 45 percent (primarily due to the Government easing most of the Covid-19 restrictions), off-setting a 10 percent decline in the first half. There is also a growing shift in net sales contribution in the three markets. Tanzania 2019s share of net sales has risen to 15 percent from nine percent in 2017 while Uganda 2019 share has also grown from 16 percent to 19 percent. Consequently, Kenya 2019s contribution has declined from 75 percent to 66 percent. Quite a very interesting shift. However, headline earnings remained flat at Kshs.8.8 per share.

Something else to note from the income statement is, EABL booked Kshs.3.25 billion (c.USD30 million) in expenses which it attributed to irrecoverable value added tax (VAT), irrecoverable withholding tax and other tax provisions. That 2019 a staggering figure and I couldn 2019 stop but wonder how its finance team would let that pass.

In finance, the income statement only reflects the fact that a wheel is moving, which in itself can be a devious phenomenon. Instead, you get a lot more meat when you examine the balance sheet (kicking the tyre). Which I did. And the first thing I picked is the capital restructuring that EABL undertook in 2020 in its Tanzanian subsidiary, Serengeti Breweries. As narrated by the company, apparently it had entered into an agreement in February 2020 to purchase an additional 30 percent of the legal shareholding in Serengeti from the non-controlling shareholders. As a result of the transaction, EABL 2019 effective economic interest in the subsidiary increased from 77.5 percent to 92.5 percent, while the legal shareholding increased from 55 percent to 85 percent. The transaction was completed with an effective date of October 31, 2020. The total purchase consideration was Kshs.8.3 billion (c.USD76.85 million). Out of which Kshs.6.27 billion was paid in cash and the additional Kshs.2.0 billion was utilised to repay the outstanding loan receivables from the non-controlling interest arising from the capital restructuring in 2018. In a year when the Covid-19 pandemic reared an ugly head on economic activities across its markets, I struggle to see the wisdom in spending Kshs.8.3 billion towards buying out minority shareholders in a subsidiary. Especially now that the company has had to borrow Kshs.11 billion from the market at 12.25 percent for the next five years. My expectation is that cash conservation would have been a key priority for management. I know EABL has had to deal with some hostile co-shareholders in Tanzania; but whatever the case, this transaction could have been frozen temporarily. Or better still, it could have been executed on a non-cash basis.

The second item is the company 2019 continued impairment of trade and other receivables, which rose to stand at Kshs.2.0 billion (c.USD18.5 million) during the fiscal year. I think this is quite a significant amount and basically translates to cash gone down the drain. My guess is these impairments are related to Uganda when the company went on a spree to buy market share from its rivals by relaxing its credit conditions to distributors. Some of the distributors, in turn, took advantage and just never paid back. It 2019 not clear the full size of these credit losses but they have created a liquidity hole.

Finally, the company wrote off Kshs.1.2 billion (c.USD11 million) worth of returnable packaging during the year. Returnable packaging is predominantly the glass bottles. Over the past five years, EABL has written off returnable packaging worth Kshs.8 billion (c.USD74 million). That 2019 quite a lot of packaging to write off and probably speaks to the level of controls over returnables. A possible explanation could be that the market failed to return the packaging back to the company and consequently had to be written off. But that would be ludicrous.

In conclusion, I have counted four line items totaling to Kshs.14.75 billion (c.USD136.6 million), that should be of interest to its investors.
