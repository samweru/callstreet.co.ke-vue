The rebranding to Absa, across ten countries, of previously Barclays-branded businesses marks the end of an era for the blue eagle that has dominated Africa’s banking scene for a century. A domination that dates back to 1854.

Generations have passed and stories have been told and written. My own in-laws, who are career teachers, once narrated to me their first banking interactions with Barclays at the start of their teaching career, which began in Narok Boys School in 1988, a colonial school on the edges of Narok, a small town about 140 kilometers West of Nairobi.

At the time, Barclays was the only bank in the town. Every payday they lined up at Barclays Narok branch to collect their salaries, an exercise that would take several banking hours. Indeed, before the advent of third-party platforms and integrated core banking systems, paydays, especially for civil servants, were always a hectic time for banks in the 80’s and 90’s. For instance, in full contempt of other customers, teachers would take over banking halls waiting for their salaries to be processed, an exercise that would probably last an entire banking day.

Barclays Narok could only handle it for some time and when the branch reached its elasticity limit, it decided it would no longer process salaries for teachers banking with it in Narok and closed all their accounts. It was an elitist decision, you could say; but so was Barclays at the time. Opening a bank account was another whole process altogether. And such was the luxury commercial banks had back then. So much so that Barclays retained a loyal elitist legacy clientele up-to-date.

Nonetheless, Barclays remained a strong brand in Sub-Saharan Africa. In its 100 year history in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there are only two known business exits: (i) South Africa in 1986 due to anti-Apartheid pressure, but made a comeback in 1995; and (ii) Nigeria in 1989 following an indigenization decree by the then military government (in which the government took a controlling interest in 1976, leaving Barclays with 40%); however the bank maintained a representative office.

Exits notwithstanding, Barclays went on to build a fantastic franchise until its 2016 decision to exit. But Barclays first signaled an intention to exit its African operations in November 2012. At the time, Barclays and its South African subsidiary, Amalgamated banks of South Africa (or Absa), revealed a One Bank in Africa Strategy and announced that they were in negotiations to combine majority of the Barclays Africa operations.

This combination would involve Barclays’ interest in nine countries, namely Kenya, Botswana, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and the Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Mauritius and Moçambique). The Zimbabwean operations were excluded due to domestic constraints (and was later separately sold to the Mauritius based banking group FMBcapital Holdings). To consummate the transaction, Absa Group issued some 129.54 Million ordinary shares (worth about US$2.93 billion at the time), representing 18.69 percent of its market capitalization, to Barclays Plc. This increased Barclays Plc’s stake in Absa to 62.3 percent up from 55.5 percent.

The transaction provided an exit platform. In March 2016, Barclays Plc CEO Jes Staley officially announced a plan to gradually exit its African operations over a two to three year period, and affiliates had until May 2020 to rebrand. At the time of the announcement, Barclays had strong operations in SSA, ranking top five in nine out of 10 ex-South African markets, in terms of assets. It had about two million customers and a branch network of close to 400 served by nearly 10,000 employees. The African exit was a difficult decision, Jes Staley added, and would let the bank focus on its US and UK operations. But that statement was far from the truth.

I was on the CEO’s call with analysts on that day, and also carefully studied his statement in the bank’s 2015 annual report. From the tone of his statements, Jes was out to cut fat from the once complex 326-year old banking group. He wanted to make Barclays lean and less complex and more shareholder-focused. It was such an easy decision, anyway. The group’s chairman at the time John McFarlane painted a picture of a bank that had been on a treadmill, trying to lose weight, since 2008. Also very interesting that he picked 2008 as a comparison base because it epitomised the height of recklessness by global banks. But 2008 also marked the onset of a downdraft for Barclays.

For the next seven or so years, Barclays went on to halve its asset book and cut its balance sheet leverage by a third. As a senior bank analyst at the time, I picked similar developments in Barclays Kenya’s balance sheet. Barclays bank Kenya had no appetite for lending. Annual growth in It’s risk-weighted assets, a key measure of risk appetite, declined by 3.3 percent in compounded terms, between 2005 and 2011 (from a high of US$1.53 Billion to US$1.38 Billion as at 2011).

This stance was at odds with industry trend at the time and was largely to de-risk its loanbook at a time it was struggling with delinquencies. In fact, market chatter had it that the bank had placed a moratorium on lending to such sectors as real estate and agribusiness (a move that largely mirrored risk-aversion from the parent company, Barclays Plc). More specifically, there was a significant decline in the bank’s exposure to the Manufacturing and Trade sectors over the seven-year period. Instead, the bank increased the weightings of money it invested in risk-free and interest-earning assets. Indeed, in the period between 2004-2011, holdings of Government securities grew by 38 percent in compounded terms; additionally, cash holding grew by 42 percent in the same period, all of which compared unfavourably to the 11 percent growth in loans and advances. The situation would improve in 2015.

### But why did Barclays exit its century-old African business?

It was simply a numbers game. Barclays Africa accounted for 10 percent of Barclays Plc’s risk-adjusted assets, a third of total workforce (with Absa alone accounting for nearly a quarter of total group workforce) and just 15 percent of total revenues.
However, the returns were largely underwhelming, at best. At the close of 2015, Barclays Plc had allocated average equity amounting to £3.8 billion to its Africa business. While shareholders only received six percent in cash-back in 2015. If you compare six percent to the rising cost of regulation in Europe, it becomes evident that the African business was not creating value. Barclays Plc noted that while it had to carry 100 percent of the financial responsibility for its African business, it only received 62 percent of the benefits. In addition, it had to pay sizeable levies to its home regulator as a result of carrying the African business. Beyond the cost-benefit argument, Barclays was also betting against the African growth story that has been peddled for some time. It still doesn’t click.

### Loyalty separation?

But most importantly, the disappearance of the blue eagle brand has the potential to trigger loyalty separation among the brand’s diehard legacy customers. The century-old Barclays brand has been deep-rooted across Sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, it has operated in Ghana, Kenya and Zambia for 100 years, building significant brand attachment in the process. It would be difficult to obtain a divorce with the brand. But beyond the brand loyalty separation, hopefully Absa demonstrates a similar level of attachment and patience that Barclays Plc had with the businesses.
