Dear CBK....Cut down the rates!

From the onset, I have consistently stuck with my quite contrarian view that the last thing this economy needs is another round of interest rate hikes. That withstanding, I perfectly understand the fact that the Central Bank “CBK” is treading on a ‘knife-edge’ and henceforth remains a classical dichotomy case for the monetary policy custodian. However, given the sustained churn of big and disappointing headlines from the eurozone and coupled with our own erosion of macro-fundamentals since the beginning of 2011, tightening stance would not suffice.

We all know that inflation is once again rearing its ever ugly head and has been at it since the year began creating a potential for a nasty economic environment of inflation and a recession combined “stagflation”; actually, it has already created. Price increases are everywhere but food prices and fuel prices attract the most attention. We’ve all witnessed the oil prices and commodity prices skyrocket these last couple of months and now we’re getting a feel of the results. Even if we were to speculate the motive for the rate hikes: ‘propping up’ the Kenya Shilling, I hold the view that it will not force any bank in this economy to liquidate its Forex holdings. Infact, banks will still be more willing to pay top-dollar premiums for funds rather than be forced to liquidate their Forex positions; and this happened during the famous ‘August squeeze’ when a sizeable basket of Tier 2 banks (well, I’m not quite sure about Tier 1 banks) bought funds from money markets as high as 30% when they could have easily tapped into their Forex holdings. Again, you cannot talk of achieving meaningful results from an interest rate hike when banks still have quite a wider playground to fiddle with their Cash reserve ratios “CRR” to as low as 3%. Even further, supply side constraints have not eased; I still buy sugar at those ridiculous prices (my grandfather has since stopped taking his usual fermented porridge with sugar). So now the market is bracing itself for a falling liquidity, declining credit availability, a deteriorating economic outlook and another massive policy disappointment. At the moment, the Shilling seems to be in no mood to respond to the latest hike (and don’t tell me of lag time); in fact, the local unit has strengthened to highs of 103 versus the greenback. So what does this mean for your near term asset allocation? In my view, quities will still continue to track the Shilling in the mid-term; so for any investor in this market, just make sure you play the primary bond issues, and don’t miss any! The prevailing secondary yields are not conducive for any outright purchase, just leave it to the sell-buy-back players. I say primary market because it’s very possible for the T-Bill to hover at 18% at this rate. And at 18%, who wants to wake up and go to work? And even beyond that, which bank will be willing to lend to the market…net effect, Lazy Banking! And in the words of Ade Ayeyemi, this economy is bank led and I mean enterprises (whether large or small) depend on bank credit to ‘soup up’ their production. So it is that time CBK cut the crap and stopped applying those exotic monetary models used in the developed world, bearing in mind that we are still a ‘kodogo economy’.
