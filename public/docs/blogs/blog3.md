Kenya wants to adopt inflation-targeting but hasn't laid enough grounds for adoption

Kenya’s central bank, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), has released a white paper in which it envisions what it calls a forward-looking monetary policy approach, away from the current monetary aggregates targeting approach which has been in place since the substantial amendment of the Central Bank Act in 1996. Let’s first provide a context to all these. Generally, the amount of money in circulation (or money supply) can be categorized into two: (i) narrow money, which includes notes and coins as well as reserve money with the central bank; and (ii) broad money, which, in addition to the notes, coins and reserve money, includes the more illiquid forms of money – such as term and non-term bank deposits, treasury bills and bonds as well as foreign currency holdings (that can easily be changed to cash). In modern economy, commercial banks create broad money whenever they make a loan to their customers (the so-called fiat money), which runs contrary to the widely held view that banks can only lend out deposits that they already have. In fact, it is loans that create deposits, and not the other way round.

Nonetheless, there are limits to how much banks can create new money in an economy and monetary policy provides the ultimate limit. By constantly calibrating the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks (known as base or policy rate), a central bank sets the tone for the cost of money in an economy. It can tighten or loosen its base rates, and this act of calibrating base rates directly affects the amount of lending that goes on in an economy. Through this moderation, the apex bank achieves its price stability objectives.

In the white paper, the CBK wants to move away from targeting all the aggregates of money (narrow and broad money) to targeting inflation. But why? First, of course Governments, including Kenya’s, regard inflation as bad for their economies (on paper). It erodes savings, can trigger capital flights and can even trigger social and political unrest. As a result, bringing inflation under control is top of list for any economic policy. Beyond inflation being a plague, Kenya’s financial system has also become a little bit more sophisticated to the extent that storing electronic balances is no longer the preserve of commercial banks. A significant number of non-bank actors have come into play, led by M-Pesa, of course. As result, the demand and use of physical cash has been moderated. This has tended to weaken the thrust of using monetary aggregates as policy targets as has been manifested through excessive fluctuations in short-term interest rates (see Chart below).

Indeed, between 2019 and the time of my writing, the weighted average interest rate in the overnight interbank market has ranged between 1.6 and 8 percent. And as observed by the International Monetary Fund, these wild swings are driven by the larger banks dominating the market, remaining inefficiencies in the processing of large government transactions, and unsterilized FX interventions.

In the envisioned forward-looking approach, the CBK makes public a numerical inflation target and then takes appropriate measures to steer inflation outcomes towards that target; and the apex bank says it has rolled out certain reforms towards the attainment of the same (including improving its forecasting capabilities). While the modernization of current framework was long overdue, I offer three criticisms of the white paper. First, inflation-targeting demands of complete central bank autonomy. A central bank that chooses inflation targeting must be free in choosing the instruments to achieve the rate of inflation that the government deems appropriate. I am not very sure that’s the case with CBK. Secondly, in the era of fiat money, and where governments can print their way out of crises, monetary policy modernization ought to now include full employment, something which is missing from the whitepaper (and this can be a whole debate). To re-quote a former CBK Governor, the bank has been accused of “pursuing price stability rather dogmatically while it ought to be focusing more on enhancing economic growth, especially given the current level of poverty in the country”. Third, the paper is too lethargic when it comes to policy signalization. I was expecting more reforms. In an inflation-targeting regime, language and communication are core monetary policy tools and offers a platform for any central bank to reinforce credibility in financial markets. To give you an example, on July 26, 2012, Mario Draghi, the former Governor of the European Central Bank (and current Italian Prime Minister) stood up and made the famous declaration: that the bank would do ‘whatever it takes to preserve the euro”. That statement alone was viewed as so credible that Italian and Spanish bond yields fell by about 2 percentage points by the end of 2012, without the ECB actually having to make any bond purchases. That was the art of policy signalization. When it comes to CBK, I expected the following additional reforms on communication: (i) full transcripts of any MPC meeting to be made public including personal statements of monetary policy committee members; (ii) CBK Governor to testify twice in a year to a Parliamentary committee that deals with economic matters on the progress of achieving its objectives; (iii) the bank to publish ex-post information on its foreign exchange operations, such as volumes and number of participants; and (iv) CBK to report on the state of its balance sheet on a monthly basis.
